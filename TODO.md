### TODO before production:
[] Fix login and registration.  Make it actually secure.
    [] Write tests for logins with multiple users
    [] Persist login between sessions.
[] Make email save to database, so I can definitely never send email to anybody who gives me their email address

[] make `docker-compose up` run everything as multiple containers... so it's nice and easy to deploy on a server
