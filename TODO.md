### TODO before production:

[] make sure setup.sql runs and migrations are solid.  Python shouldn't be creating tables!


[] Fix login and registration.  Make it actually secure.
    [] Write tests for logins with multiple users
    [] Persist login between sessions.
[] Make email save to database, so I can definitely never send email to anybody who gives me their email address
